- Used npx create-react-app to create some npm boilerplate.
- Pasted in the initial tic-tac-toe code.
- Passed a prop called "value" to the square so that the grid displayed
	the numbers 0-8.
- Added an event handler to the square buttons so that they would log a
	simple "click" message to the console.
- Added a contructor and state variable to the square so it can remember
	if it has been clicked.
- Moved the handling of each square's state to the Board class.
- Added a variable to store the current players turn. Alternate the
	variable after each click.
- Created a simple helper function to tell who has won. Check which
	player has won on each render.
- Added code to end the game when a player has won.
