Changelog:
  - Used npx create-react-app to create some npm boilerplate.
  - Pasted in the completed tic-tac-toe code from the tutorial.
  - Added a turnCount variable to the board state that allowed the board to
    keep track of the current turn number.
  - Prevented the board from adding any more squares if turnCount is at least 6.
  - Added a selectedIndex to the board state that allowed the board to keep
    track of the currently selected square (assuming there is one).
  - Added coloring to the squares to differentiate between selected and
    non-selected squares.
  - Added logic to select squares if they are clicked on.
  - Created a function that found adjacent squares to a specific square.
  - Used the adjacent square function to change the background color of squares
    adjacent to the selected square.
  - Added logic to allow players to move selected squares to available adjacent
    squares.
  - Added on to the adjacent square function to check if moving to that square
    would result in a win.
  - Added logic to only allow winning moves or moves that vacated the center
    square if a player has a piece in the center square.
  - Condensed some of the if statements and cleaned up some of the logic.
