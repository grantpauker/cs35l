Exercise 2.1
	1. (* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1))
	2. (+ (logb (* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1))) 1)
	3. It opens up a buffer that describes what the key binding C-h k does. This because C-h k itself opens up a buffer describing what a key binding does, and you are asking it to describe C-h k.
	4. It opens up a buffer that describes what the key binding M-SPC does. This because C-h k opens up a buffer describing what a key binding does, and you are asking it to describe M-SPC. M-SPC deletes all whitespace around a point, leaving just 1 space.
	5. The general way to do M-SPC is cycle-spacing.

Homework:
	1. When invoked on /dev/null, an IndexError is thrown
	2. When invoked with python3, a syntax error is thrown. This is because they slightly modified the way try-except blocks are handeled in python3.
	3. When invoked with python2, a syntax error is thrown. This is because the string formatting I used is not compatible with python2.
